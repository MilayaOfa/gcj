# Solutions to the [Google Code Jam][1] problems

This repository contains solutions to the [Google Code Jam][1]
problems. These solutions are provided "as is". I give no guarantees that they
will work as expected.

## Instructions

You can compile all the problems by issuing the following command:

    $ make

If you want to compile only a specific problem, issue the following command,
replacing `<problem_id>` with the section and id of the problem you want to
compile (see section "Problems Solved" for the list of possible ids):

    $ make <problem_id>

Running a compiled problem is just a matter of executing a command similar to
the next one, replacing `tic-tac-toe-tomek` with the section and id of the desired problem:

    $ ./tic-tac-toe-tomek

## Problems solved
